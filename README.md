# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Stack Overflow Survey

The proposal of this analysis is to use the Stack Overflow survey to get insights of the technology work enverioment and answer questions such as average code experience, professional coders by country and much more.




## Delving in The Data
Looking through the data we have, we can see many columns with missing values or misplaced, specifically from the USA. After cleaning the data for the first time, we can find new interesting insights. As we start examining the employment status filtered by country, we notice the United States leading in every category of professional coders except part-time jobs, where Germany is tied with the USA despite having only 25% of the workers compared to the United States.

Exploring the same chart, we can also see that the leading employment status is full-time for every country listed. Freelancing is also a popular option and has been growing in recent years.

Towards the end of the chart, we notice there is a small percentage of not-employed programmers. In the USA, fewer than 2000 programmers are unemployed, compared with over 40,000 survey responses.

Another noteworthy data point is the small percentage of retired programmers, which is nearly 0 in every country listed.

Moving to the next subset, we are examining the numbers of different categories of developers. Most countries follow the same distribution where FullStack and Backend developers lead the numbers, followed by FrontEnd, Admin, and Mobile, competing for the last position in all countries listed.

Next, we are going to look at which degrees are the most popular and how they have changed over the three years our survey covers. Computer Science leads the way every year but experienced a drastic decline in 2020, losing almost 40% of total numbers compared to the past two years. The number of people without majors is much lower than popular belief, with less than 1000 users. The second most popular degree is different engineering disciplines, and the least common is Social Science.

Moving to the last dataset, we are examining the numbers of professional coding experiences in each survey and their relation with compensation. In the first year, we received more concentrated data where developers had 5 to 20 years of experience. In 2019 and 2020, our data range expanded, and we received replies ranging from 3 to over 30 years of experience.

Looking at the last chart, we observe a clear relationship between years of professional experience and annual compensation. There is a major gap in the initial years, where the difference in salary between someone with 2 years of experience and 7 years can be triple or more. However, there is a slowdown in wage growth after the 9-year mark.

## Conclusion
After examining every chart, we arrived at a few conclusions. We observed how the distribution of developer categories varies in each country, the significance of major degrees, particularly the most popular ones, and how experience and compensation are closely linked.
